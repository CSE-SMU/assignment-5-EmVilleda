# Assignment 5 Postmortem

## What's your name?
Emely Villeda-Principe


## How difficult was this assignment?
Still pretty difficult


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
I definitely learned how to try to search for information on my own, even if I didn't finish


## How could this assignment be improved?
The whole point of the assignment was to make us figure this out through our own means, so this accomplished that pretty well. Helping any more than that would take it away.


## Any other comments?
I don't like Ionic very much.
